What you seek is here:

There was a scene cut from *The Matrix* where Neo took the red pill.  
The first thing he saw was a billboard:  

**“Software Engineering: a different way of doing the same thing every twenty years.”**

And what about me?  
I’m an old dog in the world of software engineering.  
Old dog, new tricks, and still loving every byte of it.
